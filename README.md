# What is it?
We use data of calls to 311 NY-non-emergency services to explore the incidents happenning of the ZIP codes where we reside.
1. We calculate how many total incidents of the top 10 frequently happened types in zip 10025.
2. We analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code than they are in general.
